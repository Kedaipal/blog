# Kedaipal Blog

A static blog (HTML/CSS/JS) styled like kedaipal.com. Posts are managed in Sanity.

- **Sanity project:** `opzqnhfl`, dataset `production` (public read), owned by the Kedaipal work account
- **Manage:** https://www.sanity.io/manage/project/opzqnhfl
- **Previous project:** `cvycqoxz` (Kris's personal account). Kept read-only as the
  source of truth for anything not yet copied across — do not delete it until
  every post is confirmed present in `opzqnhfl`.

## Folders

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html`, `post.html`, `styles.css` | The blog pages. `post.html?slug=…` shows one article |
| `js/config.js` | Sanity project ID and dataset used by the website |
| `js/sanity.js` | Fetches posts from Sanity and turns them into HTML |
| `js/demo-data.js` | Sample posts. Shown only if `projectId` in `js/config.js` is empty; also used by `npm run seed` |
| `studio/` | Sanity Studio, where posts are written |

## Run locally

```bash
# The blog (must be served over http, not opened as a file, for Sanity to allow it)
python3 -m http.server 3000        # then open http://localhost:3000

# The Studio (in a second terminal)
cd studio
npm install                        # first time only
npm run dev                        # then open http://localhost:3333
```

## Writing posts

In the Studio, open **Posts → +** and work down the form:

- **Title**, then click **Generate** for the slug
- **Images** (each has a crop icon for setting the hotspot):
  - **Card image**, 1200 × 750 px (16:10): blog home cards and featured slot
  - **Article banner – desktop**, 1800 × 771 px (21:9): top of the article on computers and tablets
  - **Article banner – phone**, 1200 × 750 px (16:10): top of the article on phones
  - Only the card image is needed; the banners fall back to it when empty
- **Summary, category, author, publish date**
- **Feature on blog home:** puts the post in the large top slot (the newest ticked post wins)
- **Body:** use the style menu for Heading, Subheading and Quote; the list buttons for bullets and numbers; and the **+** button to insert an **Image**, **Audio** (MP3/M4A, with an optional caption or transcript), **Tip box** or **Divider**
- **Cover when there is no image** (collapsed): the text and colour of the branded block used when no cover is uploaded

Click **Publish**. Drafts never appear on the site. New posts show within about a minute.
Categories (and their order in the filter bar) are edited under **Categories**.

## Deployment

The blog is a **Cloudflare Worker serving static assets**, live at
<https://blog.kedaipal.com>. Every push to `main` triggers a Cloudflare Workers
Build, which runs `npm run build` and deploys `dist/`.

The custom domain is declared in `wrangler.jsonc` (`routes` with
`custom_domain: true`), so deploying creates the hostname binding and its DNS
record — there is nothing to click in the dashboard to keep it working.

| Piece | Where it lives | How it ships |
|---|---|---|
| The website | this repo | push to `main` → Cloudflare Workers Builds |
| The posts | Sanity project `opzqnhfl` | published in the Studio; live within ~a minute |
| The Studio | `studio/` in this repo | `cd studio && npm run deploy` → <https://kedaipal-blog.sanity.studio> |

`npm run build` copies **only** the public site into `dist/` — `studio/` is never
published. It is an allow-list; see the comment at the top of `build.mjs` before
adding a new top-level folder.

To deploy by hand from a clean checkout: `npm run deploy`.

### Sanity CORS — required, or the blog shows no posts

Posts are fetched from Sanity **in the browser**, so Sanity must allow the exact
origin serving the page. An origin that is not on the list gets a `403` and the
blog renders its shell with zero articles.

⚠️ Project `opzqnhfl` currently has **no CORS origins configured at all** — every
origin gets a 403. At minimum `https://blog.kedaipal.com` and `http://localhost:3000`
must be added before the blog can render anything.

Adding an origin needs access to the Sanity project:

```bash
cd studio && npx sanity cors add https://blog.kedaipal.com --no-credentials
```

Or via <https://www.sanity.io/manage/project/opzqnhfl> → API → CORS origins.

## Notes

- After changing `styles.css` or anything in `js/`, bump the `?v=` number on those links in `index.html` and `post.html` (e.g. to today's date) so browsers download the new files instead of a cached copy.

- Articles are rendered in the browser, so search engines that don't run JavaScript won't see post text.
  For strong SEO, a later step is to pre-render pages (e.g. with Astro or Next.js) using the same queries in `js/sanity.js`.
- `npm run seed` **replaces** the sample documents (IDs `post-…`, `category-…`, `author-…`) with the versions in `js/demo-data.js`. Don't run it once the client has edited those posts.
